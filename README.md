  ## Description
  An easy to use expense tracker for anyone looking to keep track of their day-to-day expenditures in a visually pleasing way. Now everyone can see where all their money is going!(fast food for me) This app can also be downloaded for offline usage.

  ## Installation
  To download simply click the small icon in the searchbar where the website URL is located. There will be a small download icon right next to where the usual star is located for bookmarking a website at the end of the searchbar.

  ## Usage
  To use this application, just enter the total amount you would like to keep track of. Amounts added in the future will be the same process. First click in the input field labeled "Name of Transaction" and enter the name of the transaction. This could be something like "Initial Deposit". Once that is completed, move to the second input field labelede "Transaction amount" and enter the amount to be added. Once that is done just click the "Add Funds" button to add the amount to the total. This will give a starting point for other transactions. This will be the exact same process when adding things like deposits or "Christmas Money" as an example of a fund to be added, and will increase the total. The process is also the same for expenditures, with the only difference being that the user would then click the "Subtract Funds" button to reduce the total by the given amount. A graph will be displayed to show the total changes over time.
